Output: 2 3 4 5 6

Question: Print Integers
Given two integer numbers M and N, write a program to print the integers from M to N.

Input:

The first line of input will contain an integer.

The second line of input will contain an integer.

Output:

The output should be printing an integer in each line, starting from M to N.

Example:

For example, if the given numbers are 2 and 6, the output should be

Similarly, if the given numbers are -2 and 2, the output should be

Approach
To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

Read the input numbers M and N.
Use a while loop to print the numbers from M to N.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

Step 1: Read the input numbers

First, we need to read the input numbers M and N. We can use the input() function to read the input and int() to convert it into an integer.

Step 2: Use a while loop to print the numbers

Now, we will use a while loop to print the numbers from M to N. The loop will continue until m is less than or equal to n. Inside the loop, we will print the value of m and then increment it by 1.
